git commands start with "git":

init - initializes a git repository for the first time
add - tracks files (use git add . to track all files)
status - shows current tracked files
commit -m "" - commits the tracked files (basically saves them)
push - pushes to the remote repository
checkout - used to switch branches or specific commits
checkout -b  - creates a new branch and switches to it in one line
